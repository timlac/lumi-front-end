# Luminance Front-End 

Behavioral Analytics.

## Suggested Features

Display emotions which exceed a certain predefined probability threshold.
Display Histograms for arousal and valence.

## Theoretical Considerations

When considering the visualization of the analysis of a video, a functional viewpoint can be helpful:

- Positive Valence is theoretically associated with goal congruence, approach behavior, and positive affect.
- Negative Valence is theoretically associated with goal incongruence, avoidance behavior, and negative affect.

- High Arousal is theoretically associated with high intensity, high energy, and high engagement.
- Low Arousal is theoretically associated with low intensity, low energy, and low engagement.

It is a plausible hypothesis that generally higher arousal should predict better outcomes for the simple reason 
that a client which is more engaged is more likely to be receptive to the therapy.

However, the correlations between arousal and engagement are more complex, for emotions like sadness which are typically
characterized by low valence and low arousal, a higher emotion activation (e.g. more sadness) would probably be negatively
correlated with arousal. 

On a more granular level, it would make sense to seek to monitor how the conversational dynamics influence the 
valence and arousal of the client. Specifically, does some topics lead to sudden engagement or disengagement?
Which topics lead to response characteristics that are indicative of positive or negative valence? These questions must 
be considered in relation to the theoretical framework of the therapy.

## Tools 

**https://streamlit.io/** suggested by Luis as a tool for creating dashboards.

# Getting Started with Create React App

Pick the right version of node:

### `nvm use 16.20.2`


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
